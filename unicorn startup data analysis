Aboput the data 
Unicorn startups are privately held companies with a valuation of $1 billion or more. The term "unicorn" was coined to represent the rarity of such companies, 
as they were once considered rare and mythical. However, over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the number of unicorn startups, 
especially in the technology and e-commerce sectors. These companies are often seen as disruptors and game-changers in their respective industries and attract significant
attention from investors and the media. Some well-known examples of unicorn startups include Uber, Airbnb, SpaceX, and Zoom.
